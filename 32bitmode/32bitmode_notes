Transforming from 16bit to 32bit
- registers are extended to 32 bits. add an 'e' to register names. eg: ebx, eal, eah...
- for convinience there are 2 gen purpose registers, fs and gs.
- 32 bit offsets are available, eg 0xffffffff denotes 4gb of memory.
- Sophisticated segmentation and Interrupt handling.

GDT - global descriptor table - defines memory segments and their protected mode attributes.
Once we have defined the GDT, we can use a special instruction to load it into the CPU,
before setting a single bit in a special CPU control register to make the actual switch.
GDT is necessary to load the kernel.

We can no longer use BIOS once we have switched to 32bit protected mode.
So, 32 bit machines must provide its own drivers for all hardware of the machine.

Printing on screen- Earlier in BIOS we used an interrupt to print what we wanted. But in 32 bit mode
we have 2 modes of display - text mode and graphics mode which is used by manipulating the memory range
of the respective mode. When computers boot they begin in VGA mode. Therefore, programmer doesnt need
to render individual pixels to describe specific char, since a simple font is already defined in 
the internal memory of the VGA display device.
So to display a char on the screen we need to set its ASCII code to correct memory address for VGA mode
which is 0xb8000. 
Note: the screen is displayed as rows and columns, video memory is simply sequential. address of 
column 5 and row 3 is : 0xb8000 + 2 * (row * 80 + col)
