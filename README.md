#  MinOS
##  a primitive OS created from scratch

This project is a self learning project I embarked upon during my OS university course.
It is heavily inspired by a documentation by Nick Blundell.

The components implemented till now are:
- created a kernel
- bootstrapped the kernel using a bootsector
- implemented 32 bit protected mode 

Issue 
- strings in kernel cannot be passed

I will write a blog post soon for better understanding of concepts.
